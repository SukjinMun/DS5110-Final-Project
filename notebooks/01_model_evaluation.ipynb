    "## 4. Recommendations for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Models:\n",
    "1. **Address class imbalance:**\n",
    "   - Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for ESI levels 1, 2, 5\n",
    "   - Apply class weights in model training\n",
    "   - Consider stratified k-fold cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature engineering:**\n",
    "   - Add interaction terms (e.g., age × vital signs)\n",
    "   - Include chief complaint embeddings or clustering\n",
    "   - Add historical patient data (prior ED visits)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Alternative models:**\n",
    "   - Random Forest (handles imbalance better)\n",
    "   - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)\n",
    "   - Ensemble methods combining all models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Models:\n",
    "1. **Wait time model:** Currently performs well, minor improvements:\n",
    "   - Add ED occupancy features (current patient count)\n",
    "   - Include staff availability metrics\n",
    "   - Consider time-series lag features\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Volume model:** Needs improvement:\n",
    "   - Add holiday indicators\n",
    "   - Include weather data if available\n",
    "   - Try negative binomial regression for overdispersion\n",
    "   - Add seasonal decomposition features"

    "## 5. Clinical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wait Time Prediction:\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** ±14 minutes prediction error is acceptable for ED planning\n",
    "- **Use case:** Can inform patients of expected wait times at triage\n",
    "- **Strong ESI correlation:** Validates clinical practice (higher acuity = faster treatment)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ESI Classification:\n",
    "- **Current limitation:** Cannot reliably detect ESI level 1 (most critical patients)\n",
    "- **Safety concern:** False negatives for level 1 patients are unacceptable\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Use model only as decision support, not replacement for triage nurses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volume Forecasting:\n",
    "- **Current accuracy:** Moderate, suitable for rough staffing estimates\n",
    "- **Improvement needed:** Better prediction crucial for shift planning\n",
